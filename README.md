I'm currently developing an Angular application named "Dragons Quest" that involves a hero on a quest to slay a dragon with three companions (Knight, Sorcerer, Paladin, and Druid). Each class follows a unique path with specific steps until they reach the final goal of killing the dragon. The application starts with a class selection screen, and based on the chosen class, the user goes through a series of steps.

I need assistance in creating a main (smart) component that renders tiles containing images and subtitles representing choices for each step. Additionally, the component should include buttons for navigating to the previous or next step, and a stepper at the top to display the all the steps and which step the user is. Also, the amount of steps could vary dpeneding on the coices. The entire application should be seamlessly integrated with NGRX.

Could you provide guidance on structuring the main component, handling state management with NGRX, and ensuring a smooth flow through the different steps for each class?
